# Distributed-Machine-Learning
Basically , the aim of the project is to gain an understanding of distributed training of machine learning algorithms. Here, I am planning to use a VGG-11 network, trained on CIFAR-10 dataset . Next, I will be developing code implementing distributed data parallel training for the same.
